//Write a class called BadCipher which does not store any data.
//It should provide a member function called Encrypt.
//The function receives a string representing the data to encrypt and returns a string with the encrypted data.
//The encryption process is to reverse the input, remove the first character and add it back at the end, and shift each character up by 1 (i.e. a = b, J = K, z = a).
//Add some tests to check the encryption process works. For example:

//Additionally you could mark the class and member function as static which allows you to call the function without creating an instance of the object.
//(Thatâ€™s how things like Console.WriteLine("hi") and Convert.ToSingle("5.1") work).
//After making the change you can simplify the usage code to this:
//Now try adding a static Decrypt function which reverses the process. For example:

using System.Diagnostics;
